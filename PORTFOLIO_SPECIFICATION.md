- **Shadows**: Soft, layered shadows for depth
- **Borders**: Minimal, when used
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace for breathing room

## 3D Scene Specifications

### Concept: "Personal Expression Engine"
An abstract, continuously evolving 3D scene that represents creativity and innovation:

#### Visual Elements
1. **Morphing Geometry**:
   - Fluid, organic shapes that transform over time
   - Geometric patterns that emerge and dissolve
   - Layered transparency effects

2. **Dynamic Patterns**:
   - Flowing lines that connect and disconnect
   - Particle systems with organic movement
   - Gradient shifts across surfaces

3. **Animation Loops**:
   - 60-90 second transformation cycles
   - Smooth, continuous motion
   - No jarring transitions or repetitive patterns

#### Technical Implementation
- **Performance**: 60fps on desktop, 30fps mobile minimum
- **Responsive**: Simplified version for mobile devices
- **Loading**: Progressive enhancement with fallback static image
- **Memory Management**: Efficient geometry updates and cleanup

## User Experience (UX)

### Navigation
- **Header**: Fixed, minimal navigation bar
- **Transitions**: Smooth page transitions with Framer Motion
- **Mobile**: Hamburger menu with slide-out navigation
- **Indicators**: Current page highlighting

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full 3D experience, complex layouts
- **Tablet**: Optimized 3D scene, adapted layouts
- **Mobile**: Simplified 3D or static fallback, mobile-first layouts
- **Performance**: Device-specific asset loading

### Accessibility
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**
- **Keyboard navigation**
- **Screen reader compatibility**
- **Reduced motion preferences**
